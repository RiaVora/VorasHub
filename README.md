# VorasHub

PURPOSE: For my independent 3D Printing company Vora's Hub, I want to create a website that allows customers to both purchase
premade items and submit a custom order for a 3D printed object. Previously, I have gone through 3D Hubs to receive orders from customers,
but I have been unable to showcase items for potential customers (who don't have an exact design in mind) to purchase. I want to open
up the 3D Printing industry from entrepreneuers to everday individuals who can integrate inexpensive, high-quality 3D Printed parts in
their daily life, and I plan to do this by introducing individuals to these 3D printed objects through the website. The website will have
credit card and PayPal integration, a cart, a login, sections for each price, the option for custom orders, and a story about me and my
dream.
